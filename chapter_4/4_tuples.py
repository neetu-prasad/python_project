# creatig a tuple using()
t = (1, 2, 3, 6,)

#printing the elemnts of tuple
print(t[0])

# t1 = () --> empty tuple
#t1 = (1) --> wrong way to declare a tuple with single element
t1 = (1,)  # --> tuple with single element
print(t1)

#we cannot update the velues of a tuple
# t[0] =34 #it will throw an error saying tuple object does not support item assignment
